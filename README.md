# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study 🚲
## A Complete Data Analysis Project Using R, Tableau & Google Sheets

Welcome to my capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
In this case study, I take on the role of a **junior data analyst** at **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.

The business objective: **analyze user behavior to develop strategies that encourage casual riders to become annual members.**

This project follows the full data analysis process — **Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act** — and includes work in **R, Google Sheets**, and **Tableau** to deliver actionable insights and compelling visualizations.

## 🧩 Project Objective

Cyclistic’s director of marketing wants to increase the number of **annual memberships**, which are significantly more profitable than casual single-ride or day-pass users.

**Business Task**:  
> Identify how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
